Description of the IP Network Traffic Flows Labeled with 75 Apps Dataset

In the world of datasets used for classifying network traffic, the primary aim typically revolves around categorizing IP flows into general groups, such as web browsing, DNS queries, FTP transfers, peer-to-peer (P2P) activities, Telnet, and more. However, our IP Network Traffic Flows dataset takes a significant leap forward by delving into the precise identification of individual applications within these IP flows. This expansion broadens our horizons to encompass 75 specific applications, including prominent names like Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and numerous others.

Key Dataset Highlights:

Diverse Application Identification: A distinguishing feature of our dataset is its ability to pinpoint a wide array of specific applications rather than settling for broader categories. We've painstakingly annotated IP flows associated with Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and 72 additional applications, offering a comprehensive understanding of network traffic content.

Prediction of "protocol_name": Given that "protocol_name" falls within the categorical realm of our dataset, we've leveraged a series of machine learning models for its prediction. This predictive task is pivotal in comprehending the underlying communication protocols governing network traffic, shedding light on the methods and standards employed for data transmission.

Utilization of Machine Learning Models: To achieve our classification objectives, we've harnessed the capabilities of various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. These models empower us to effectively categorize IP flows based on the provided features, enhancing the dataset's versatility.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): In our pursuit of efficient feature reduction and dimensionality reduction, we've incorporated Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This technique streamlines our dataset, enhancing the performance of our machine learning models by mitigating the impact of redundant or less informative variables.
