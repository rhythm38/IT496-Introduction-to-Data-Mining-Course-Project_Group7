# Course Project 3 (ICC Cricket World Cup 2023)

In this project, we have performed 3 tasks as specified in the project requirements. There are 4 Jupyter notebooks in this repository, which are described below:

## Scraping.ipynb

This file contains the code we have used for scraping data from the internet to be used as datasets for different tasks in the project.

## Task1.ipynb

## Task2.ipynb

In this file, we have built a model to predict the playing 11 for the teams playing the final match. The finalists have already been predicted in task 3 and we have used a representative team for showcasing the prediction of our model.

## Task3.ipynb

In this file, we have predicted the winner of the World Cup. For this, we have used a step-by-step approach. We used a dataset of all matches played between 2015-2023 before the World Cup and built a model to predict the winners of each match in the current World Cup. From the winners list, we built a leaderboard to obtain the teams qualified for semi-finals. Then, we virtually conducted the semi-finals and finals to obtain the winner of the World Cup.
